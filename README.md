# espCar

A very simple program to control a RC car, over the WiFi, using the ESP8266 WiFi module.

The server program which runs on the ESP module is written in C.

The client program which runs on a laptop etc. is written in java and uses
the keyboard arrows to send the directions(movement) to the server over the WiFi.
